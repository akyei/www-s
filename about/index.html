<h4>About Our Chapter</h4>
<p>Sigma Phi Delta is an international social fraternity of engineers founded at the University of Southern California April 11, 1924. Restricted to engineering students, it is therefore a professional social fraternity. Although it is a relatively young fraternity, Sigma Phi Delta has grown steadily over the past 90 years — reaching nearly 40 universities worldwide — and continues to expand today. It is well organized, and its chapters are carefully supervised by the national officers and by faculty and alumni advisers.
Sigma Phi Delta was organized to promote the advancement of the engineering profession and of engineering education, to encourage excellence in scholarship, and to develop in its members the highest ideals of manhood, good citizenship, and brotherhood. </p>
<p>The Beta-Iota Colony of Sigma Phi Delta was founded at the University of Maryland on February 25, 2012 and became an Active Chapter in June of the same year. Our goals and objectives follow along well with those of our international counterparts. We are frequently involved in many types of events: Professional Events, like grad panels and tours of facilities such as the Goddard Space and Flight Center; Philanthropy Events, such as our annual trip to volunteer for the KEEN Program in Washington, D.C.; and Social Events, including trips to play paint ball, laser tag, and more. With 37 Active Brothers as of the beginning of 2015, we strive to continue our proud traditions and have fun along the way.</p>

<h4>Principles</h4>
<p>Declaration of Principles and Objects
From time to time the Fraternity, or Greek, system is called upon to set forth the principles for which it stands. So far, it has been able to offer a satisfactory explanation for its existence. As a part of this system - as a Fraternity of Engineers we insist that whatever our own superficial peculiarities, we exist for a purpose.
</br></br>
We stand steadfast and firm in our belief that we serve as a necessary adjunct to our Colleges and Universities in the training of young engineers. Our Constitution states, without equivocation, that the Object of the Fraternity shall be to promote the advancement of the Engineering Profession; to foster the advancement of Engineering Education; to instill a greater spirit of cooperation among Engineering Students and Organizations; to inculcate in its members the highest ideals of virtuous manhood, good Citizenship, obedience to Law, and Brotherhood; and to encourage excellence in scholarship. These objects we endeavor to fulfill in our Laws, in our Ritual, in our conduct and in our relations with others.
</br></br>
The Sigma Phi Delta Fraternity has, since its founding on April 11, 1924, at the University of Southern California, been a Professional-Social Fraternity of Engineers. We are Professional in that, unlike the General Fraternity, we admit to membership only students enrolled or working in a curriculum, or program, leading toward a degree in engineering; that we encourage and expect our Chapters to conduct and to participate in a continuing professional program through symposia, seminars, field trips, and similar programs; and that we encourage our members to give the fullest support to the faculty of the Colleges and Schools of Engineering throughout North America.
</br></br>
We are Social in that, similar to the General Fraternity, our members maintain and live in Chapter houses; have a social program; participate in athletic programs; and foster a close relationship with our graduated, or alumni, members.</p>
